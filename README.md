## About the Video Course
Google Colaboratory is an online platform to perform data analysis. It enables you to create interactive Jupyter notebooks that mix text with Python code to run queries and display data analysis results. Stored on Google Drive you'll be able to run notebooks and collaborate with peers through Google's cloud services.

In this course, you will learn to solve problems and obtain key results with data. You will begin by building your own Jupyter notebook before you explore and learn the basics of Google Colaboratory. Then you will explore several file formats to store data and use SQLite to query large datasets. Next, you will learn to initialize 1D and 2D data structures with the Numpy and Pandas libraries to help organize and summarize metrics such as the mean, median, and standard deviation of your data.

Moving further, you will learn to identify outliers in your data, eliminate dirty data and perform common data transformations. Finally, you will use qualitative and quantitative data types with Matplotlib to display effective charts and visuals. By the end of this course, you'll have the tools to perform data analysis to tell your compelling stories with data.
